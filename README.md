# TEP CMS
This evergrowing, powerful content management system is perfect for your website

### File-based Content Management
All your website content is saved as JSON files inside a folder called content. This means your website doesn’t rely on slow or complex databases, making it fast, reliable, and easy to manage.

### Organized Asset Management
Uploads and user-added files go into the assets/uploads folder.

Standard images and base assets that come with the site are stored in assets/base.
You can easily add, change, or remove images and files by managing these folders directly.

### SCSS for Styling
The CMS uses SCSS for styling your website, so you can write clean and flexible styles that compile quickly. You can run and edit SCSS locally with your preferred tools.

### Live Preview Editing
Make changes to your site’s content while seeing exactly how it looks to your visitors. This live preview editing ensures you get the best results without guesswork.

### Easy to Run Locally
Set up and run the CMS on your local machine for development and testing. This gives you full control and makes changes safe before publishing.

### Fast and Reliable
Because everything is file-based and doesn’t rely on databases, the CMS loads quickly and works smoothly even with lots of content and assets.
